Explanation of the Code
The provided Java class, SecurityConfig, is a configuration class for Spring Security in a Spring Boot application. It sets up in-memory authentication with two users and configures HTTP security to require authentication for all requests. It also enables form-based login and HTTP Basic authentication.

Here's a breakdown of the components:
@Configuration and @EnableWebSecurity:
These annotations indicate that this class provides Spring Security configuration. @EnableWebSecurity enables Spring Security's web security support and provides the Spring MVC integration. 🌐

AuthenticationManagerBuilder:
This is used to set up in-memory authentication. It allows specifying usernames, passwords, and roles directly within the configuration. 🔑

PasswordEncoder:
This is used to encode passwords before storing them in memory. In this case, it's autowired into the constructor, suggesting that the bean is defined elsewhere in the application context. 🔒

@Value Annotations:
These are used to inject values from the application's properties files (typically application.yml or application.properties). Here, they're used to inject user passwords, enhancing security by avoiding hard-coded passwords in the source code. 📄

@PostConstruct and initAuth():
The initAuth method, annotated with @PostConstruct, ensures that this method is executed after the bean's properties have been set and just before the bean is put into service. It configures the in-memory authentication details. 🚀

SecurityFilterChain:
This bean method configures HTTP security, requiring authentication for all requests, setting up form login, and enabling HTTP Basic authentication. 🛡️

This setup ensures a robust security configuration, leveraging Spring Security to protect the application against unauthorized access while providing a flexible authentication mechanism.
